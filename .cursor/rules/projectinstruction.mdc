Present AI responses with relevant visualizations and metrics


Business Analytics Features:

Foot traffic estimation for retail potential
Time-based analysis (e.g., noise levels at specific hours)
Demographic insights for targeted marketing
Competitive analysis (nearby businesses)



Backend Requirements

Data Layer:

Time-series data store for temporal queries
Geospatial database for location-based queries
Mock datasets for:

Hourly/daily foot traffic counts

API Services:

Geospatial query endpoint to handle area selection
Natural language processing service for query interpretation
Data aggregation service for generating insights
Authentication and user preferences storage


AI Integration:

LLM-based service for understanding business queries

Query suggestions based on selected area
Visual indicator of which area is being analyzed


Analytics Dashboard:

Time-based graphs showing trends
Demographic breakdowns with visual representations
Comparison tools for different areas or time periods
Exportable reports with key insights


UI/UX Considerations:

Maintain the current dark theme with purple/teal accent colors

Start with the area selection tool and basic data visualization
Implement mock data responses for common business queries
Develop the AI chat interface with standard responses
Enhance with more sophisticated data analysis and visualizations
Refine the UI/UX based on user feedback
